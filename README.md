# POTUS-tts
This Python 3.x program reads an external data file "Data\\potus.txt" containing all president names of the USA to-date (2022), and user can enter a query to and hear the names of presidents as the result. The query can be a number such as a first N presidents, or last N presidents, or Nst/th president, or all presidents to date. Spoken audio is in American English and can also be saved as a mp3 file to the user's folder in "Data" subdirectory as "POTUS-TTStest3.mp3".

After it loads the data file, it searches in memory for finding the value by user-entered index to get the results.
Libraries used: pyttsx3, pandas

This is both and educational application from programming as well as from historical perspective. This core codebase can be easily extended to a graphical user-interface, web application and mobile application.
